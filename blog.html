          <h2>Why Python</h2>

          <p>
            I have been a Java developer my entire career, at school, we used to have Sun Microsystems' terminals in the library and that's where I spent most of my time. My first development language was C, then C++ but then Java quickly caught my attention because it was easier to write programs and could do this Object-Oriented programming everybody was talking about so I quickly fell in love with it.
            I still love Java, but, sometimes I feel the need to learn something new, I like data analysis and I see Python is the language of choice for a lot of professionals. In the company I am currently working on, there is a team that is using Python for web development instead of the default tech stack, I have noticed how fast they go which has me wondering how are they doing it.
            I'm excited to begin this journey and I hope I can find all the answers to my questions.
